# GoNexusHub

Small Go application that pulls data from the NexusHub API for WoW items and shows information and recent prices.

Works both on Windows and Linux. You'll have to edit the source code if you want to use it for servers other than Mograine-Alliance. 
In general you don't have to bother with characters like ':' in the item names. But you'll have to use '-' in things like Enchantments, since that is how NexusHub API is setup.

The Graphs look smooth on my machine, I think that glitch is the fault of AsciiCast. I can't be bothered to look at it.
